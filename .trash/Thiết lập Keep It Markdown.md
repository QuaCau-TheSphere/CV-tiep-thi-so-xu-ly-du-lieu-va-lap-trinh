# Thiết lập Keep It Markdown

2. Vào PowerShell
3. Đi đến nơi cài đặt


    Navigate to your Google Account Page
    Click on the Security option on the left
    Under the Signing in to Google header select App passwords
    Choose Select App and select Other, the name can be anything you want but I suggest something identifiable such as "KeepItMarkdown"
    Click on Generate and Copy the password that's generated
    Run the following command and logon with your Google email and the newly generated application password.

> python kim.py

If you entered your Google email and application password correctly, you should see a successful login with the statement -> "You've succesfully logged into Google Keep!"
