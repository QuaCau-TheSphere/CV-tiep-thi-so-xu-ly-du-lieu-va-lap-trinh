```javascript
> JSON.stringify(error);
'{}'
```

From the document of [JSON.stringify()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify),

> For all the other Object instances (including Map, Set, WeakMap and WeakSet), only their enumerable properties will be serialized.

and `Error` object doesn't have any enumerable properties, that's why it prints an empty object.

**Background on enumerable properties**

In Javascript, an object can have two types of properties:

- enumerable properties
- non-enumerable properties

The exact distinction is a bit tricky, but basically:

- "normal" properties, such as the ones you create by assignment ( `myobj= {}; myobj.prop1 = 4711;`), are enumerable,
- "internal" properties, such as the `length` property of an array, are non-enumerable

In particular, an `Error` has _only_ non-enumerable properties.

For details, see for example [Enumerability and ownership of properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties) on MDN.
