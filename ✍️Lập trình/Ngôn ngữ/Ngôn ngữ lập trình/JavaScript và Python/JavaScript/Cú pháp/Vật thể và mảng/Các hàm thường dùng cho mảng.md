## What makes this cheat sheet so civilised?

There are plenty of other JavaScript array method cheat sheets out there. They show you _all_ the array methods. They are comprehensive. They call themselves the ‘ultimate’ or the ‘definitive’ cheat sheet. And if that’s what you want, by all means use those.

This cheat sheet is different. It doesn’t list all the array methods. But it does list the most interesting ones—the ones most likely to save you lines and lines of code. It lists the methods that will help change the way you think about solving problems with arrays. These are tools that will help you start writing civilised JavaScript.

And unlike other cheat sheets, this one doesn’t start with a list of methods. Instead, it starts with the problem you’re trying to solve. Instead of sending you off into the wilderness without a map, it gently guides you to the right method. That’s what makes it civilised.
