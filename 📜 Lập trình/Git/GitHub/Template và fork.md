- A new fork includes the entire commit history of the parent repository, while a repository created from a template starts with a single commit.
- Commits to a fork don't appear in your contributions graph, while commits to a repository created from a template do appear in your contribution graph.
- A fork can be a temporary way to contribute code to an existing project, while creating a repository from a template starts a new project quickly.
