By not creating a branch and putting the PR in to the default branch (`main`, `master` or whatever), you run the risk that it will be very difficult to add later commits to your fork, or get new changes from the parent repo.

For example, these problems would happen if the PR was declined. It could also happen if the maintainer squashed the changes.
