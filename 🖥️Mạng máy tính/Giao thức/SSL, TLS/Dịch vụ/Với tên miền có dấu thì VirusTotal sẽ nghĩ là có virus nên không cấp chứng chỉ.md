When I checked with [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/70b25cdf4fafc7d16f402d688c189554d186a80dc223ec0c2aa4ca46c0015779/detection "VirusTotal"), only one security vendor flagged this URL as malicious. The rest flagged it clean.

I suppose this is a false positive. But how should I solve this?
